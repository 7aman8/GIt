This will have the steps of (git) or what I have understood from using (git)

Git: is a CL version control, it is where you can -keep changes in code
                                                  -sync code between computers


Git controls/CL :-

* git clone repository_url => this will clone the repository(flike_older that contains source_code) and gives you access to the code
* git add file_name => will keep track of changes to code

    Commits(changes in code) and saving changes to code :
* git commit => saving a snapshot(time-line changes) of the repository --> this keeps track of the changes that happened to [git add file_name]
* git commit -m "your_description" => adding a message to what you made/changes to the code
    - this will save a snapshot of the current code, so i can also got to certain snapshots(code versions)

* git status => will tell us what's currently happening to our code
