This will have the steps of (git) or what I have understood from using (git)

Git: is a CL version control, it is where you can -keep changes in code
                                                  -sync code between computers

Steps:-
1. use (git add file_name)
2. use (git commit) => to save changes
3. use (git commit -m "add a message") <- necessary
4. use (git push) to get and add the changes to [github]

Git controls/CL :-

* git clone repository_url => this will clone the repository(flike_older that contains source_code) and gives you access to the code
* git add file_name => will keep track of changes to code
    to add all_files --> git add --all

    Commits(changes in code) and saving changes to code :
* git commit => saving a snapshot(time-line changes) of the repository --> this keeps track of the changes that happened to [git add file_name]
* git commit -m "your_description" => adding a message to what you made/changes to the code
    - this will save a snapshot of the current code, so i can also got to certain snapshots(code versions)

* git status => will tell us what's currently happening to our code
* git push => will put/push it into [github]
* git pull => this is will take all the changes in [github] that you dont have and put them into your current repository(snapshot)
    - your local repository will have all the changes from [github]

            Short cut to --> git commit -m "message" and git add
* git commit -am "message" => this will commit to github and select all the files while also providing a message
